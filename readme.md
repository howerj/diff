Here's a diff I had lying around. If you found it useful, great, if not go
away. If you find a bug, submit a pull request, don't cry to me about it.

This also includes a utility for finding similarity in text using pop-count,
xor and setting bits depending on the characters, digraphs and trigraphs in the
text.
